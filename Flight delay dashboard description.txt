This dataset contains detailed flight performance and delay information for domestic flights in 2024, merged from monthly BTS TranStats files into a single cleaned dataset. It includes over 7 million rows and 35 columns, providing comprehensive information on scheduled and actual flight times, delays, cancellations, diversions, and distances between airports. The dataset is suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning tasks such as delay prediction, time series analysis, and airline/airport performance studies.

Monthly CSV files for Januaryâ€“December 2024 were downloaded from the BTS TranStats On-Time Performance database, and 35 relevant columns were selected. The monthly files were merged into a single dataset using pandas, with cleaning steps including standardizing column names to snake_case (e.g., flight_date, dep_delay), converting flight_date to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD), converting cancelled and diverted to binary indicators (0/1), and filling missing values in delay-related columns (carrier_delay, weather_delay, nas_delay, security_delay, late_aircraft_delay) with 0, while preserving all other values as in the original data.
